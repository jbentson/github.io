        <h2>Darci Bentson</h2><img src="images/mom.jpg" width="280" height="460" alt="" align="right" />
        <p>Merry Christmas Mom! Love you most! </p>
        <h3>Probable Plans for Hollidays</h3>
        <p>By the time my mom's days off role around, you'll catch her in the mornings with a hot cup of tea, likely snuggled up in a blanket with our dog Mac, as well as a good book on the kindle fired up. She works really hard with long hours at her job normally, so relaxing is a main focus for break.</p>
        <h3>What's on Their Lists:</h3>
        <p> Other than her own personal website made by her son, some things my mom would have on her list would be gift cards for her favorite local stores, and also massage vouchers. </p>
        <h3>Other Fun Facts</h3>
        <p>My mom is the best role model I could ask for. Her dedication, and passion she shows for everthing she does is inspiring. Also excels in speedwalking, </p>
