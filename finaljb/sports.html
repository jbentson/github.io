                <h1 id="soccer">Soccer</h1>
                <p> Soccer is and has allways been the most popular sport in the Netherlands. Most people in the country live for the game of soccer. Everyone comes together in masses when the National team plays. And the stadiums are packed for almost every season game for clubs.</p>
                <p>The Netherlands are historically one of the best nations in the world when it comes to soccer. They have always had some of the best players. The only thing they lack is titles. Considering how good the National team has been in multiple eras, they never won the World Cup and they only managed to win the Euros once in 1988. In the picture on you can see one of Netherlands' greatest strikers Marco van Basten lift the European Cup. But what people mostly talk about when it comes to the Dutch national team is the finals and semifinals losses, the most famous one being the 2010 World Cup final against Spain, when Andres Iniesta scored the winner late in overtime. </p>

                <p> It's not just the Dutch national team that has been succesful in Europe and the rest of the world. The Dutch club teams have managed to win a lot of Champions League titles. Ajax for example dominated the 70s with 3 Champions League wins in a row. They won a total of 5 Champions League titles. That is the 6th best out of any club in Europe. 2 other Duch clubs, Feyenoord and PSV, both won 1 title each. That is a lot of titles for a country that is not considered one of the top 5 countries in Europe when it comes to club teams. </p>
                <p id="space"> Especially in the last couple decades when investors started to put a lot of money in the Spanish, English, German, Italian and French leagues. That money became massively important when it comes to winning in Europe. The Dutch clubs got left behind and became more developmental clubs for talented youngsters. Ajax is known around the world as probably the best club for developing young talent. They went as far as reaching the Champions League semifinal in 2018, beating some of the world's best teams like Real Madrid and Juventus. This was one of the most impressive Champions League campaigns, because Ajax weren't considered contenders by anyone. Watch Ajax's road to the 2018 Champions League in the video below.</p>

                <h2 id="speedskating"> Speed Skating</h2>
                <p>The Netherlands has been the best country when it comes to speed skating for decades. Journalists have claimed it's because Dutch people go to school or work on skates and use the canals. This couldn't be further from the truth. Dutch ice skaters are lucky if natural ice is thic enough to skate on for more than two weeks. The Dutch skaters are so good, because a lot of people are passionate about the sport and actively pursue a carreer in skating. This isn't true for all Dutch people. Most ice skaters come from the privince called Heerenveen, where there's an incredible love for ice skatin (both speed skating and shorttrack).</p>
                <p> The Dutch ice skating team were possibly the most dominant team on any event in the history of the Olympic Games in the winter Olympics of 2018. The team won a record high 7 out of 14 total gold medals and also a record 16 out of 42 total medals. Down below are pictures of Ireen Wust, most medal winning speed skater of all time, and a picture of Sven Kramer, the third most medal winning male speed skater of all time. </p> <img id="wust" src="wust.jpg"><img id="kramer" src="kramer.jpg">
                <h3 id="shorttrack">Shorttrack</h3><img id="knegt" src="knegt.jpg">
                <p>As mentioned the people from the province Heerenveen are very passionate about skating, that includes shorttrack. The Dutch have some of the best shorttrack skaters in the world as well. The only country with more medals on the last Olympic winter games was South-Korea, beating the Netherlands by 2 medals. </p>
                <p>Shorttrack is a very chaotic sports, with lots of crashes and penalties that change the outcome of a race. The Dutch skaters have been hit hard at the Olympic games as well as the world cups the following years. They lost countless races in which they were projected to either win or at least win a medal. They've sufferd a lot of injuries from crashes as well. Arguable the best shorttrack kater, Sjinkie Knegt has been hit the hardest. He has gotten injured multiple times in the last year and still managed to win a medal on the Olympics and in the World Cup. End of 2019 was an all time low for the shorttrack star when he got caught in a fire that started in his home. He got a lot of burns that will put him out of competition for what remains an unknown period of time.</p>
                <h4 id="cycling">Cycling</h4> <img id="poel" src="poel.jpg">
                <p>Although cycling is not the most popular sport in the Netherlands, they do have some good cyclists. This is probably because most people ride bikes starting when they're kids. Some people ride their bikes for over 10 miles to school and back every day with hard wind and rain. There are Dutch riders in the top 10 of the big races like the Tour de France and the Giro Ditalia almost every year. Especially lately with a young exciting prospect Tom Dumoulin, who has won the Giro Ditalia before and finished top 3 in the Tour de France twice. One of which was in the same year as his Giro win. Another great cyclist from the Netherlands is Marianne Vos who, before her injureies, won almost everything there is to win for women in cycling. She won world championships, the Giro Ditalia, olympic gold medals and she also wins a lot of cyclocross races. Possibly the most exciting Dutch cyclist right now is another cyclist who started as a cyclocross racer and started to ride in street races. His name is Mathieu van der Poel, he is only 25 years old, and he is already a 3 time world champion in cyclocross. In his first year of participating in big road races he won one of the biggest one day events there is in cycling, the amstel gold race. He also got a very impressive 4th place in the Tour of Flanders. See his picture on the right.</p>
                <h5 id="fieldhockey">Field Hockey</h5>
                <p>Field hockey has been the most popular sport amongst women in the Netherlands for a long time now. What is relatively surprising is that it has become a more popular sport for men. Even as recent as 10 years ago playing field hockey was sort of fround upon for men. But even though some people look down on men playing field hockey, the Dutch national team finshed fourth in the 2016 olympic games and since 2015 they finished second in the last two World Cups. They also won two of the last 3 European Cups, finishing third the year they didn't win it. So they have established themselves as one of the best field hockey teams in the world. So the men are really goot, but the women's national team is almost undeniably the best team in the world. They finished second in the 2016 olympics and won all but one of the last 4 World Cups, finishing second the year they didn't win it. They also won the last two European Cups. </p><img id="hockey" src="hockey.webp"> </article>
