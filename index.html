    <ul>
        <li>The emergency alerts that are on the website currently because of COVID 19, throw you off a bit and it takes away from the layout. Once you hide the alerts the layout looks really good with the colors combined with the image of the government building. </li>
        <li>The loading speed is the fastest out of all 5 websites. </li>
        <li>The menu is very clear and really easy to navigate. It’s really easy to find whatever you are looking for. </li>
        <li>The layout completely changes on a mobile screen size. The menu bar disappears, and there is a menu link on the top right. The menu opens on the right of the screen. The layout is different, but it works well. It is still easy to navigate the website on mobile. </li>
        <li>This website is my favorite, because the page looks the best out of all five in my opinion. As long as the emergency alerts are hidden. The site is also very easy to navigate. There wasn’t much of a difference between Massachusetts’ website and the ones of Minnesota and Alabama when it comes to navigation and menus, but it had a slight edge. The loading speed was the best. And I like the layout for the mobile size a lot as well. </li>
    </ul> <a href="https://mn.gov/portal/" target="_blank"><h2>2. Minesota </h2></a>
    <ul>
        <li>The site looks very good. Good colors with a nice picture in the background. The layout on the homepage looks very good. </li>
        <li>It is more on the slower side when it comes to loading the different pages. </li>
        <li>The menus are very clear and therefore easy to navigate. I had no trouble finding the items I was looking for. </li>
        <li>The website is adaptable to different screen sizes, so it works well on mobile as well. </li>
    </ul> <a href="https://www.alabama.gov/" target="_blank"><h3>3. Alabama </h3></a>
    <ul>
        <li>The site is not necessarily eye pleasing in my opinion, but the colors look decent and the layout is pretty neat. </li>
        <li>The site loads fast all around, for wherever you want to do on the site. Whether its using the search command or just navigating the site using the links in the menus. </li>
        <li>The site is easy to navigate with solid menus. All the menus are labeled well and therefore I had no trouble finding the items I was looking for. </li>
        <li>The site works well on multiple screen sizes as well. Even on mobile the layout is pretty good and its easy to navigate the website. The menus fit pretty well on a mobile size screen. </li>
    </ul> <a href="https://www.nh.gov/index.htm" target="_blank"><h4>4. New Hampshire</h4></a>
    <ul>
        <li>The look on the homepage is good. Good use of image and a good choice of colors. The layout is tidy and looks good. </li>
        <li>The website loads pretty fast all around. </li>
        <li>The menu on the homepage looks good and is easy to navigate, but once you visit a different page the menus change and that makes it harder to find what exactly you are looking for. The change in layout and menus can be confusing if you’re trying to look for a specific item. </li>
        <li>The website doesn’t work well on mobile, because the size of the site remains the same. You would have to scroll all the way to the right to navigate the site when visiting on mobile. </li>
    </ul> <a href="https://alaska.gov/" target="_blank"><h5>5. Alaska </h5></a>
    <ul>
        <li>The look on the homepage is good. Good use of image and a good choice of colors. The layout is tidy and looks good. </li>
        <li>The website is on the slower side when it comes to loading speed. </li>
        <li>The menu on the homepage looks good and is easy to navigate, but once you visit a different page the menus change and that makes it harder to find what exactly you are looking for. The change in layout and menus can be confusing if you’re trying to look for a specific item. </li>
        <li>The website doesn’t work well on mobile, because the size of the site remains the same. You would have to scroll all the way to the right to navigate the site when visiting on mobile. </li>
        <li>This is in my opinion the worst website, because it loads slower than most of the other State Websites. It can also be confusing to navigate the website, because the formatting changes for the different pages. That makes it hard to find what you are looking for. Along with that the website doesn't work well on mobile. </li>
    </ul>
