    <title>Three Websites Review</title>

<body>
    <p>I really like <a href="https://www.nike.com" target="_blank">Nike’s Website</a> personally because the design is really sleek, and I have always been a fan of Nike’s products. When getting on the website I was greeted with a massive picture of Lebron, which is irrelevant but definitely a solid eye catching image, and above it was a clean menu bar where if you hovered over any of the categories a clean looking sub category list would appear below it, where you can find anything you are looking for with ease. The code is in HTML5 and was frankly pretty tough to read since most elements are simple with a big nike file wrapped by 7 or 8 stylesheet elements. The website is laid out very nicely, because it is very spread out and everything they’re advertising that is out of the ordinary, such as deals and specials, are big bold images that can be selected to take you to where you want. The colors are fairly simple, but all for a good reason. The main background colors are a crisp combo of a light grey and off-white that go well, highlighted with black “sporty” looking font. The main reason of them to keep it this simple is to insure that the colors won’t contrast with the big images, as they are being updated frequently and will not always go well with more saturated colors.</p>

    <p>I really liked <a href="https://www.squarespace.com/website-design/?channel=pnb&subchannel=go&campaign=pnb-dr-go-us-en-website-bmm&subcampaign=(website-design_design-websites_bmm)&utm_source=google&utm_medium=pnb&utm_campaign=pnb-dr-go-us-en-website-bmm&utm_term=%2Bdesign%20%2Bwebsites&gclid=Cj0KCQjwreT8BRDTARIsAJLI0KLyq8xqDdgmcjT9j6xzYFeYlYHaRgvILEPZqjFtt2BaHhQYULKcAp8aAld-EALw_wcB" target="_blank">Squarespace's Website</a>. I figured there aren’t a lot of websites that would be more well designed than an actual web host company. This website just screamed modern when I was brought to the homepage. The menu bar blends into the original screen as if it cannot move and then when I scrolled down it changed background color and followed me down as I scrolled, which I thought was pretty clean. As I scrolled I was shown a new background color for each new subject that was presented, and each color went well with the last one. This really caught my eye, as it made navigation of various information much quicker, and again it just gave a great modern look to the design. The code is in HTML5 and the code is very similar to Nike’s, which shows that both companies both have fully updated and well kept websites. Thee layout is really nice and simple, because while it does have 0 columns, the menu and homepage are well enough designed to ensure you will find you’re information swiftly.</p>

    <p><a href="https://www.berkshirehathaway.com" target="_blank">Berkshire Hathaway's Website</a> was frankly quite disturbing when I opened the website for the first time. The homepage has little to no design, and although the efficiency is there in the website, there is nothing that is eye catching whatsoever. This site’s code is pretty simple, as if it probably hasn’t been updated much with new features since the 1990s. They are using HTML5 elements and it does validate. The format is functional, which was obviously the goal of the designers. There is no scrolling effect because the page is so concise that all the information and links that lead to necessary information are in front of you when you first get onto the page. This makes navigation swift, as you can really get anywhere necessary within 2 clicks. The site uses colors to almost no extent, as the background is straight white, and the only other colors on the page are the hyperlinks in the main table.</p>
