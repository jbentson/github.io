    <H1>2. Bluehost</H1>
    
    <p>This self claimed "Best Web Hosting" service is focused heavily on support of the customer to make things run smoothly for the services they provide.  Bluehost's services are services are used much less vastly used than GoDaddy This can be seen through the options of hosting this company provides. Services include:</p>
    
    <li>Shared- Known as most popular solution for the company, provides a simple solution for small websites or blogs. </li>
       <li>VPS- "Power, control, and flexibility." This service is generally used most by people looking for root access to their website which eenables more control over the funtions. </li>

    <H1>3. Ipage</H1>    
    
    <p>Ipage shows very many differences to the previously stated web hosting services. The thing that popped out at me was the flattrate Ipage had of $1.99 a month. This rate included several things and would probably fall under the category of a "shared" website design, which is the lowest rate on the two other websites, and is priced simiilarly. Ipage provides a service to the people that don't want to get into the "nitty-gritty" of web design.  </p>
